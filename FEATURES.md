# Public Health Monitor - Feature Overview

## Core Functionality

### Real-Time Disease Outbreak Tracking
The app monitors wastewater data from 15 major Texas cities to detect virus presence before widespread illness occurs. Users receive early warnings about potential outbreaks in their area.

### Predictive Analytics
Three-layer prediction system:
1. **Trend Detection** - Identifies if virus levels are rising, falling, or stable
2. **ML Forecasting** - Predicts virus levels up to 14 days in advance
3. **Anomaly Detection** - Alerts on unusual spikes that may indicate outbreak onset

### Location-Based Personalization
- Automatic GPS detection
- Shows nearest sampling sites
- Filters data by proximity
- Personalized alert radius (default 50km)

## Data Visualization

### Interactive Elements
- Tap map markers for detailed site data
- Swipe through virus filters
- Expandable trend charts
- Modal dialogs for in-depth information

### Visual Indicators
- Color-coded severity levels (green/yellow/red)
- Trend arrows (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Confidence percentages on predictions
- Time-based chart visualizations

## Tracked Pathogens

1. **RSV** (Respiratory Syncytial Virus)
2. **COVID-19** (SARS-CoV-2)
3. **Influenza A** (including H5N1)
4. **Influenza B**
5. **Measles**
6. **Polio**
7. **Dengue**

Each includes comprehensive health information:
- Common symptoms
- Transmission methods
- Prevention guidelines
- Risk severity level

### Data Flow
1. App loads → Seeds initial data from TEPHI-based mock data
2. User selects location/virus → Fetches historical readings
3. Prediction engine analyzes → Generates 14-day forecast
4. Alert system monitors → Sends notifications on spikes
5. Map updates → Shows real-time color-coded markers

## User Experience

### Onboarding
- Automatic data seeding on first launch
- Location permission request with clear explanation
- Pre-loaded virus database with 7 pathogens
- Sample data for 30 days of history

### Performance
- Efficient data caching
- Optimized map rendering
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Background data sync

### Accessibility
- Clear visual hierarchy
- High contrast colors for severity levels
- Readable text sizes (14-24px)
- Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44px)

## Use Cases

### For Individuals
- Monitor virus levels in your neighborhood
- Plan activities based on outbreak risk
- Stay informed about emerging health threats
- Learn about prevention measures

### For Families
- Protect vulnerable family members (infants, elderly)
- Make informed decisions about gatherings
- Track multiple locations (home, school, work)
- Receive advance warning of rising cases

### For Community Leaders
- Monitor regional health trends
- Coordinate public health responses
- Communicate risks to constituents
- Access historical comparison data

## Expansion Potential

The system is designed to scale beyond viruses:
- Water contamination events
- Air quality alerts
- Chemical spills
- Environmental hazards
- Hospital capacity indicators
- Disease case reporting integration

## Data Sources

Currently uses simulated data based on:
- Texas city population data
- Seasonal virus patterns
- Historical outbreak trends
- TEPHI surveillance methodology

Production deployment would integrate:
- Official TEPHI API (when available)
- Real-time wastewater sample data
- Weather service APIs
- Public health department feeds
- Hospital system data
