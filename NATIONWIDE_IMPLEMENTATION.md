# Nationwide Wastewater Surveillance Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Data Collection (Edge Function)
**File**: `supabase/functions/data-collector/index.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed Texas-only filter (`reporting_jurisdiction='Texas'`)
- ✅ Now fetches data from ALL US states and territories
- ✅ Increased limit from 10,000 to 50,000 records to capture nationwide data
- ✅ Auto-creates sampling sites dynamically when new counties are discovered
- ✅ Stores state information in raw_data for each record

**API Query**:
```
https://data.cdc.gov/resource/2ew6-ywp6.json?$where=date_end>'[30_days_ago]'&$limit=50000&$order=date_end DESC
```

**Dynamic Site Creation**:
- Creates sites as: `"[County] County, [State]"`
- Example: `"Harris County, Texas"`, `"Los Angeles County, California"`
- Automatically assigns coordinates (with fallback to US center)
- Stores county and state fields for filtering

### 2. Updated Map View
**File**: `components/WebMapView.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Changed default zoom from 7 to 4 (nationwide view)
- ✅ Updated zoom logic to support larger regions (latitudeDelta > 20)
- ✅ Map now shows entire United States by default

### 3. Updated Main Screen
**File**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Changed default center to US geographic center (39.8283°N, -98.5795°W)
- ✅ Increased latitudeDelta/longitudeDelta from 12 to 30 (nationwide coverage)
- ✅ Updated app title from "WATHO" to "NWSS Monitor"
- ✅ Updated subtitle to "National Wastewater Surveillance System"

### 4. Updated Project Name
**File**: `package.json`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Renamed from `texas-wastewater-monitor` to `nwss-wastewater-monitor`

## How It Works Now

### Data Collection Flow

1. **Fetch**: Gets last 30 days of data from CDC NWSS for ALL jurisdictions
2. **Group**: Deduplicates by location (state-county-wwtp_id)
3. **Create Sites**: Automatically creates sampling_sites for new counties
4. **Process**: Converts CDC percentile (0-100) to risk levels
5. **Store**: Upserts into wastewater_readings with full location data

### Site Naming Convention

All sites are created with format: `"[County] County, [State]"`

Examples:
- Harris County, Texas
- Los Angeles County, California
- Cook County, Illinois
- King County, Washington
- Miami-Dade County, Florida

### Coordinate Mapping

Built-in coordinates for major counties:
- Harris, Texas → Houston (29.7604, -95.3698)
- Dallas, Texas → Dallas (32.7767, -96.7970)
- Los Angeles, California → LA (34.0522, -118.2437)
- Cook, Illinois → Chicago (41.8781, -87.6298)
- Maricopa, Arizona → Phoenix (33.4484, -112.0740)
- King, Washington → Seattle (47.6062, -122.3321)
- Miami-Dade, Florida → Miami (25.7617, -80.1918)

Fallback: US geographic center (39.8283, -98.5795)

### Database Schema

Each record includes:
```json
{
  "site_id": "uuid",
  "virus_id": "uuid (COVID-19)",
  "concentration_level": 65.667,
  "level_category": "medium",
  "trend": "stable",
  "sample_date": "2025-09-07",
  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "raw_data": {
    "source": "cdc_nwss",
    "dataset": "2ew6-ywp6",
    "wwtp_id": "3014",
    "state": "Texas",
    "county": "Harris",
    "population_served": "630000",
    "detect_prop_15d": "100",
    "ptc_15d": "3"
  }
}
```

## To Deploy & Test

### 1. Deploy Edge Function

The edge function needs to be deployed through Supabase dashboard or CLI:

```bash
# Via Supabase CLI (if available)
supabase functions deploy data-collector

# Or through Supabase dashboard:
# Navigate to Edge Functions → data-collector → Deploy
```

### 2. Trigger Data Collection

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/data-collector \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
```

### 3. Verify Nationwide Coverage

```sql
-- Check states collected
SELECT DISTINCT raw_data->>'state' as state, COUNT(*) as sites
FROM wastewater_readings
WHERE raw_data->>'source' = 'cdc_nwss'
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY sites DESC;

-- Check sample locations
SELECT 
  ss.name,
  ss.state,
  ss.county,
  wr.level_category,
  wr.sample_date
FROM wastewater_readings wr
JOIN sampling_sites ss ON wr.site_id = ss.id
WHERE wr.raw_data->>'source' = 'cdc_nwss'
ORDER BY wr.sample_date DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### 4. Expected Results

After collection runs successfully:
- ✅ 100+ sampling sites from across the US
- ✅ Multiple states represented (TX, CA, IL, FL, NY, WA, etc.)
- ✅ Sites auto-created with proper naming convention
- ✅ Recent sample dates (within last 30 days)
- ✅ Map shows markers across entire United States

## Data Coverage

The CDC NWSS dataset (2ew6-ywp6) includes:
- All 50 US states
- 7 US territories
- Tribal communities
- ~1,500 monitoring sites nationwide
- Updated weekly by CDC
- COVID-19 wastewater surveillance data

## Risk Level Calculation

Percentile values converted to risk levels:
- **LOW**: < 25th percentile
- **MEDIUM**: 25-75th percentile
- **HIGH**: > 75th percentile

Trend calculation:
- **INCREASING**: ptc_15d > 100 (>100% increase over 15 days)
- **DECREASING**: ptc_15d < -100 (>100% decrease)
- **STABLE**: -100 to 100

## Quality Score

Expected records updated to 100 (from 15) to reflect nationwide coverage.

Quality score = min(1, records_collected / 100)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated edge function
2. Run data collector to populate nationwide data
3. View the map showing entire United States
4. Check that sites appear in multiple states
5. Verify CDC data is current and accurate

The system now monitors wastewater surveillance data from across the entire United States, not just Texas!
