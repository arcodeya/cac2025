# Real Data Collection - Updated Implementation

## Changes Made (Latest Update)

### 1. Fixed Header Layout Issue ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The zip code search button was overlapping the "Wastewater Analysis for Threat & Health Observation" subtitle.

**Solution**:
- Changed header `alignItems` from `'center'` to `'flex-start'`
- Added `flex: 1` to the text container to constrain width
- Added `marginRight: 12` to headerContent for proper spacing
- Added `numberOfLines={2}` to subtitle text to prevent overflow

The search button now properly displays without overlapping the subtitle text.

### 2. Updated Data Collection to Use REAL CDC Data ‚úÖ

**Problem**: TEPHI dashboard (https://dashboard.tephi.texas.gov) is a dynamic React/Next.js application with no public API. The dashboard was last updated October 6, 2024, and cannot be scraped with simple HTML parsing.

**Solution**: Switched to CDC NWSS (National Wastewater Surveillance System) API as the primary data source.

## Current Data Collection Implementation

### Primary Data Source: CDC NWSS API

**API Endpoint**: `https://data.cdc.gov/resource/g653-rqe2.json`

**What It Does**:
- Fetches last 30 days of Texas wastewater data
- Filters for Texas counties: `$where=state='TX' AND sample_collect_date>'[date]'`
- Orders by date descending: `$order=sample_collect_date DESC`
- Limits to 5000 records to ensure we get complete data

**Data Coverage**:
- Real wastewater surveillance data from Texas counties
- Includes: COVID-19, Influenza A/B, RSV, Mpox, Norovirus
- County-level data mapped to major Texas cities
- Actual concentration levels and sample dates
- Real treatment plant names and reporting jurisdictions

### County to City Mapping

The system maps CDC county data to Texas cities:

```
Harris County ‚Üí Houston
Travis County ‚Üí Austin
Dallas County ‚Üí Dallas
Bexar County ‚Üí San Antonio
Tarrant County ‚Üí Fort Worth
El Paso County ‚Üí El Paso
Collin County ‚Üí Plano
Nueces County ‚Üí Corpus Christi
Lubbock County ‚Üí Lubbock
Webb County ‚Üí Laredo
... and more
```

### Data Processing

1. **Fetches** from CDC API with last 30 days filter
2. **Transforms** county names to city names
3. **Maps** pathogen names to our virus types
4. **Calculates** level categories (low/medium/high) from concentrations
5. **Deduplicates** to keep only latest reading per city-virus combination
6. **Upserts** into database (updates existing or inserts new records)

### Concentration Thresholds

Different viruses have different threshold levels:

```typescript
COVID-19:     medium: 100, high: 1000
Influenza A:  medium: 50,  high: 500
Influenza B:  medium: 50,  high: 500
RSV:          medium: 80,  high: 800
Norovirus:    medium: 1000, high: 10000
Mpox:         medium: 10,  high: 100
```

### Data Quality

- **Confidence Score**: 0.9 (very high for CDC official data)
- **Source Attribution**: Each record tagged with `source: 'cdc_nwss'`
- **Quality Scoring**: Based on data completeness (expected ~40 records)

## How to Verify Real Data Collection

### Test the Data Collector

```bash
# Manually trigger data collection
curl -X POST \
  https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/data-collector \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Check Collection Logs

```sql
SELECT
  run_date,
  status,
  records_collected,
  source_identifier,
  data_quality_score,
  execution_time_ms
FROM data_collection_runs
ORDER BY run_date DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Verify Real Data in Database

```sql
SELECT
  ss.name as city,
  vt.name as virus,
  wr.level_category,
  wr.concentration_level,
  wr.sample_date,
  wr.confidence_score,
  wr.raw_data->>'source' as source
FROM wastewater_readings wr
JOIN sampling_sites ss ON wr.site_id = ss.id
JOIN virus_types vt ON wr.virus_id = vt.id
WHERE wr.raw_data->>'source' = 'cdc_nwss'
ORDER BY wr.sample_date DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ `source = 'cdc_nwss'` in raw_data
- ‚úÖ `confidence_score = 0.9`
- ‚úÖ Recent sample dates (within last 30 days)
- ‚úÖ Real county and WWTP names in raw_data

## Data Update Frequency

### CDC NWSS Updates
- CDC publishes new wastewater data regularly
- Data typically includes samples from the past 2-4 weeks
- Updates vary by collection site (some weekly, some bi-weekly)

### Our Collection Schedule
- **Automatic**: 1st of every month via monthly-scheduler
- **Manual**: Anytime via app's "Refresh" button
- **On-Demand**: Via edge function API call

## Why CDC NWSS vs TEPHI?

| Feature | CDC NWSS | TEPHI Dashboard |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Data Access | ‚úÖ Public API | ‚ùå No API |
| Format | JSON | Dynamic React/JS |
| Reliability | Very High | Medium (scraping) |
| Coverage | Nationwide + TX | Texas only |
| Update Frequency | Regular | Last update: Oct 6, 2024 |
| Official Source | ‚úÖ Federal CDC | State Partnership |
| Ease of Use | Direct API | Would need browser automation |

**Decision**: CDC NWSS is more reliable, officially maintained, has a public API, and provides the same wastewater surveillance data for Texas.

## Benefits of Current Implementation

1. **Real Data**: Actual CDC wastewater surveillance measurements
2. **Reliable**: Official government API with SLA
3. **Recent**: Last 30 days of data, regularly updated
4. **Comprehensive**: Multiple viruses and Texas locations
5. **Maintainable**: No scraping fragility or structure changes
6. **Attributable**: Clear source provenance in database
7. **Compliant**: Uses public API as intended

## Monitoring Data Freshness

The app shows a data freshness indicator:
- üü¢ **Green**: Data is fresh (< 14 days old)
- ÔøΩÔøΩ **Yellow**: Data is aging (14-30 days)
- üî¥ **Red**: Data is stale (> 30 days)

Users can tap "Refresh" to trigger immediate collection.

## Technical Notes

### Edge Function Updates
- Removed ineffective HTML parsing logic
- Focused on CDC API as primary source
- Both "primary_feed" and "backup_feed" now use CDC API
- Improved error handling and logging
- Better data transformation and validation

### Data Deduplication
The system keeps only the latest reading per city-virus combination to avoid duplicate entries on the map.

### Source Transparency
All data records include:
```json
{
  "raw_data": {
    "source": "cdc_nwss",
    "original": {
      "county": "Harris",
      "wwtp_name": "...",
      "reporting_jurisdiction": "Texas"
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential additional data sources:
- State health department APIs
- WastewaterSCAN (Stanford/Verily)
- NWSS Data Tracker updates
- Regional wastewater authorities

## Summary

‚úÖ **UI Issue Fixed**: Search button no longer overlaps subtitle
‚úÖ **Real Data Collection**: Now using official CDC NWSS API
